    "18/ Examples Assuming DAI expirable price aligns with the spot price at maturity if you decide to cash-settle your position, you'll receive 1,030 USDC, making a $30 profit. Your ROE is $30 / 120 USDC = 25%",
    "17/ Examples DAI interest rate = 6% USDC interest rate = 3% DAI expirable price = 1.03 USDC You can short 1000 DAI with 120 USDC (lev 8x) and then wait till expiry.",
    "16/ Arb Interest Rates between Stables As I mentioned before, expirable prices are determined by interest rates, meaning they could differ between stablecoins. You could profit from the spread, assuming the spot price when you enter the position will be the same at expiry.",
    "15/ Cash &amp; Carry This method is the same as hedging mentioned before, creating a delta-neutral position. You can long on Contango and short on futures perp, collecting funding fee. Note that the spread between 2 positions have to be lower than the total expected funding fee.",

    "8/ Hedging Example Let's say you buy 1 $ETH at $1,000 on the spot. If you want to hedge this position, here's what you can do:",
    "7/ Hedging You hedge when you long an asset on the spot and short the same asset on expirable at the same time and vice versa. Expirables are better in a sense because you know the cost up-front, compared to perps with their unpredictable funding rates.",
    "6/ Speculation Example If you choose cash settlement, you don't need to pay the additional 610 USDC. Your ROE will also be $90 (23% = 90 USDC/400 USDC).",
    "5/ Speculation Example At expiry, you can opt for physical delivery/cash settlement. If you choose physical delivery, you receive 1 $ETH by paying an additional 610 USDC, regardless of the spot price. Let's say $ETH pumps to $1,100. You can sell your ETH and get a $90 profit.",
    "4/ Speculation Example $ETH spot price is 1,000 $USDC. Market sentiment is positive making the expirable price for ETHUSDC 1,010 (+1% basis). You're bullish, so you long 1 ETHUSDC with 400 USDC as collateral (~2.5x lev).",
    "3/ Speculation Just like your regular trading, you go Long if you're bullish on a certain asset, you go Short if you're bearish on a certain asset. You also can do this with stablecoin when its price deviates from its peg. The advantage of trading on Contango? Cheap fee!",

    "24/ Another things to note: - there won't be vesting period for the token - contrary to other mechanism, protocol owned liquidity is harmful because it incentives farmers to dump on Timeless - the large reserves could act as indirect backing to $LIT and sets rough floor price",
    "23/ The call option results in: - transferring gains from farmers to the protocol without affecting LPs - farming is less lucrative but giving Timeless cashflow - Timeless could take advantage of continuous token sale instead of giving away free tokens",

    "12/ You can also hedge by holding PYT &amp; NYT, with more NYT than PYT. By adjusting the ratio, you can adjust the yield volatility.",
    "11/ Note that NYT's price move more when the yield rate drops compared to when it pump meaning yield hedging benefit &gt; downside risk. Check out the pricing model to see why.",
    "10/ Yield Hedging Since NYT move the opposite direction of the yield rate, you can buy some NYT to hedge against your position that's generating yield.",

    "12/ Why other protocols are not implementing this? Because they use non-stable as collateral, increasing the liquidation risk of those assets. They also need to back 1:1 on every nominal exposure because of their built-in hedging model which is super capital inefficient.",
    "11/ Why this is huge? If they can implement this to all of their pool/vault, they can achieve a deep liquidity with a fraction of the TVL. Achieving total capital efficiency. Though they have to make sure their liquidation mechanism is top-notch.",
    "10/ Makers Leverage How does it work you may ask. Since LPs take opposite side of every trade, you can think them as trader themself. So they can get liquidated when the position moves against them.",

    "6/  relies on  v2 ‚àí an options infrastructure protocol. They charged a premium for those \"repackaged\" options. Because there will always be people buying options either to hedge or gain exposure, this strategy is sustainable.",
    "5/ By depositing your assets, you are selling the potential upside of your assets. e.g. you're selling $2500 $ETH call option by the end of the year; you can get 2% yield. If $ETH goes to $3k, you're giving up $500, but you're farming that yield.",
    "4/ Why do they need our assets to write options? Because it's a covered call. Each option is collateralized 1:1 to the underlying asset. e.g. 1 ETH call options need 1 $ETH as collateral.",

    "30/ So am I at risk of liquidation using that approach, bizyugo? Well, it depends on how much more interest you are paying on your debts compared to your earnings on your deposits. Euler estimates your time to liquidation on how high your excess interest rate is.",
    "29/ Euler accommodates users who recursively borrow to farm the token with a Mint feature. From the example below, you have $11,000 $RBN and $10,000 $RBN debts. Without the Mint feature, you can only borrow &lt;$1,000 of $RBN, which means you can 10x your capital.",

    "26/ Reactive Interest Rate Euler uses control theory to autonomously ‚Üë or ‚Üì the rate of change in interest rates when utilisation is above or below a target level of utilization. Reactive interest rates adapt to market conditions for the underlying assets in real-time.",
    "25/ Reserve also take fees on liquidation by requiring a slightly larger amount than the position being liquidated. The base liquidation discount starts at this fee level, so the fee is paid by the user being liquidated.",
    "24/ The proportion is called the 'Reserve Factor' (RF) and each lending market has its own specific parameter. It has to balance the trade-offs for each type of assets: - RF 0 = no reserves accrue = bad debt - High RF = lower lender interest = lender will run",
    "23/ Euler Reserves Euler takes a portion of the interest paid by borrowers into their reserves. It's in eToken (interest-bearing deposited assets), meaning Euler reserves earn interest automatically. This allows the reserves to act as a lender in the worst case of a bank run.",

    "20/ Euler implements Dutch auction-like bidding for the liquidators, where they allow the discount on position to rise relative to how under-water the position is. This prevents would-be liquidators from engaging in priority gas auctions.",
    "19/ Liquidation You (borrower) are in violation if the value of your risk-adjusted liabilities &gt; the value of your risk-adjusted collateral. In this case, you still have enough collateral to repay your loan, but you're considered to be at risk of defaulting.",

    "14/ TWAP For prices, Euler relies on Uniswap v3's time-weighted average price (TWAP) ‚àí calculating the price using the geometric mean price of an asset over some interval of time. This is out of our scoop, so if you're interested, you can read more here",
    "13/ Euler factors in asset-specific risks of both downside and upside price movements (increasing capital efficiency). With this, the liquidation threshold is tailored to the specific risk profiles associated with the assets you borrow and deposit as collateral. For example üëáüèª",
    "12/ Risk-adjusted Borrowing Capacity Over-collateralization is encouraged by limiting how much borrowers can take out as a loan. Unlike other protocols that only factor in the borrowers' collateral value going down, Euler also factors the borrower's debt value going up.",
    "11/ Fee-less Flash Loans It is fee-less (except gas costs) to take flash loans on Euler because Euler only charges fees for how long you borrow the assets. From blockchain perspective, flash loans are held for a duration of 0 seconds, making them free.",
    "10/ Protected Collateral On  you can choose to make your deposited collateral unavailable for lending making it 'protected'. Of course, you won't earn any interest, but your funds are safe from defaulting borrowers and can be withdrawn instantly.",
    "9/ What's the use of those, you ask? - You can borrow assets from all 3 tiers (manage multiple positions) - You only need to approve Euler's access to a token once (save gas costs) - No approvals are required to transfer assets and liabilities between sub-accounts (max control)",
    "8/ I mentioned a separate Euler account on tweet 3. Yeah, what do you mean by that bizyugo? Because of the asset tiering, Euler allows you to access up to 256 sub-accounts (including your primary account).",
    "7/ Assets can move up from one tier to another through governance. By promoting assets, capital efficiency will increase but also the risk to the user (more volatile, lower cap assets). That's why these tiers have to be considered carefully.",
