# AI Token Decision-Making Agent

## Overview

The AI Token Decision-Making Agent is designed to assist users in making informed decisions about whether to **buy**, **hold**, or **avoid** a cryptocurrency token. It leverages a combination of market data and custom decision logic, guided by personalized reasoning profiles. The agent aims to provide reliable investment suggestions based on a range of real-time metrics.

## How It Works

### 1. **Market Data Analysis**
The agent gathers real-time data from multiple sources, including market cap, 24-hour trading volume, and trending score, to evaluate the performance and stability of a given cryptocurrency.

### 2. **Score Calculation**
The agent generates a **total score** based on three key metrics:
- **Trending Score**: Measures the popularity and market movement of the token.
- **Market Cap Score**: Reflects the financial stability and size of the cryptocurrency.
- **Liquidity Score**: Assesses how easily the cryptocurrency can be traded without impacting its price.

### 3. **Decision-Making Process**
Using the scores, the agent determines whether it is a good time to invest in a particular token. If the total score is above a certain threshold, the agent will recommend **buying** the token. If the score is lower, the agent may suggest **avoiding** it.

### 4. **Personalized Reasoning**
The agent employs different reasoning based on two distinct personalities:
- **Murad**: Offers a more optimistic approach with strong convictions, focusing on long-term potential and high-score investments.
- **Bizyugo**: Provides a balanced view, evaluating both opportunities and risks, with a focus on liquidity and immediate trends.

### 5. **Examples of Interaction**
- A user might ask, "Should I buy [Token]?" and the agent will respond with a decision and detailed reasoning, including factors like market cap, volume, and trend.
- The reasoning is personalized and reflects the agentâ€™s evaluation based on its character, either **Murad** or **Bizyugo**.
